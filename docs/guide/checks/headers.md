# Headers Check

Analyzes HTTP security headers using the drHEADer rule engine.

- **Check type:** `headers`
- **Endpoint:** `POST /v1/check/headers`
- **Default:** Yes (all targets)
- **Deep variant:** None

## What Is Checked

- Presence and correctness of security headers (Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, etc.)
- HTTPS enforcement (whether the target redirects to or serves over HTTPS)
- CSP report-only mode without an enforcing policy

## Understanding Findings

| Severity | Example findings |
|----------|-----------------|
| critical | Target served over HTTP without HTTPS |
| high | Missing Strict-Transport-Security, missing X-Frame-Options |
| medium | Missing Content-Security-Policy, CSP in report-only mode without enforcement |
| low | Missing Referrer-Policy, missing Permissions-Policy |
| info | HTTPS enforced |

Findings are generated by the drHEADer rule engine, which evaluates headers against established security best practices. Each finding explains which header is missing or misconfigured and why it matters.

## Raw Data Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `url` | URL that was checked |
| `status_code` | HTTP response status code |
| `headers` | All response headers as key-value pairs |
